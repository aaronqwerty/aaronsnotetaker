## Description
This app helps users keep track of notes.<br />
Once the note is no longer needed they can remove the note.<br />
They can also amend the note if something changes.<br />
<br />
Please note some functionality is not currently available due to a lack of time available this week. I hope to resubmit this assigment in the coming weeks.
